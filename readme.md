# Contact Students

The "Contact Students" project was designed to automate and simplify the communication process between tutors and students. With a user-friendly and intuitive interface, tutors can input student information, select a time slot, and the type of tutoring session, and send a message directly to the student via WhatsApp. All this without the need to manually save the student's contact.

## Features

- **Student Name**: A dedicated space to input the full name of the student.
- **Phone Number**: A field to input the student's phone number. The number must be exactly 11 digits long.
- **Time Slot Selector**: Allows you to choose a specific time for the tutoring session. Available times range from 07:00 to 22:00.
- **Tutoring Type**: A selector with options "Class Make-up", "Reinforcement", and "Undefined".

After filling out all the fields, simply click the "Send" button, and the default browser will open, directing you to WhatsApp Web with the message ready to be sent to the student.

## Benefits

- **Process Automation**: No need to save the student's contact to send a message anymore.
- **Time-saving**: The communication process is sped up, allowing tutors to focus on other important tasks.
- **Standardization**: Ensures all sent messages follow a standard, avoiding confusion or misunderstandings.
